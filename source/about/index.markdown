In 2009, I founded Ars Mentis, because I believe that technology exists to enhance our lives. Through my company, I’m doing my part to achieve that goal. My company runs on the principle that all problems have a solution, and I make it my goal to find the best possible solution for my clients. Keeping open communication is extremely important to me, so I can develop a deep understanding of my client's needs.

Since founding Ars Mentis, I've grown my business each year. By 2012, Ars Mentis had grown large enough that I was able to pursue software consulting full time. I continue to build my client base and expand my business yearly. I've been a driving force behind NSB AppStudio (NSBasic Corp), worked for Michigan State University's College of Law and  developed solutions for many other clients.

About Me
--------

I’ve been programming since the early 1990s and began my first part-time IT consulting business in 1995. My professional career began in 1997, and I continued working primarily in IT until 2000, when I began writing software professionally. 

Since 2001, I’ve concentrated on writing custom software, and I specialize in web applications, mobile applications, and automated data transformation and conversion.
