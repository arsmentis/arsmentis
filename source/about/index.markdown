About Ars Mentis
----------------

Technology should enrich lives, not complicate them.

I started Ars Mentis in 2009, because I wanted to help others use technology to streamline their professional endeavors. In the years since, the company and client list have both grown and become more varied. From designing a database for one of the world’s largest law repositories to creating an online employment application for for a family-owned cleaning business, I’ve found fixes for a broad range of clients. My lines of communication are wide open, and my quality standards are high. I want things done right.

All problems have solutions. Let me solve yours.

About James Kruth, Founder
--------------------------

I was that geek in your high school.

The one who started programming when he was 8, started building computers at 13, then started his own IT consulting business at 15. Playing guitar in a garage band helped offset things a little, but there was still no denying my geek status.

Geek or not, I didn’t care. I loved computers then, I love them now, and I love helping others find ways to make technology work for them. Before starting Ars Mentis, I worked for companies both large and small, public and private.

I’ve designed custom software at all levels and specialize in web and mobile applications as well as data transformation and conversion. Basically, I like making stuff work, and I like showing other people how to do the same.

I still play guitar. Just to even things out.
