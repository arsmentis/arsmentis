I founded Ars Mentis in 2009 because I believe that technology exists to enhance our lives, and through my company, I am doing my part to achieve that goal. My company runs on the principle that all problems have a solution, and I make it my goal to find the best possible solution for my clients. To do this, I believe open communication is extremely important so that I can develop a deep understanding of my client's needs.

Since founding Ars Mentis, I've grown my business each year. In 2012, Ars Mentis had grown large enough that I was able to pursue software consulting full time - and I continue to build my client base and expand my business yearly. I've been a driving force behind NSB AppStudio (NSBasic Corp), have worked for Michigan State University's College of Law, and have developed solutions for many other clients.

About Me
--------

I’ve been programming since the early 1990’s, and began my first, part-time IT Consulting business in 1995. My professional career in IT Consulting began in 1997, and I continued working primarily in IT until 2000, when I began writing software professionally. 

Since 2001, I’ve concentrated on writing custom software, and I specialize in web applications, mobile applications, and automated data transformation and conversion.
