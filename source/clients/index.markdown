I run my business on the principle that every problem has a solution, so I work with any kind of client - from big, for-profit businesses, to small non-profit organizations, and everything in between. Honestly, if you have a good idea and the money and passion to support it, I can work with you to get that idea off the ground.

The following is a list of just a handful of clients I've worked with over the years:
