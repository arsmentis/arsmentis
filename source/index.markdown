Welcome to Ars Mentis. I create custom software solutions for clients of any size. If you have an idea that you think a computer can handle, I can build software that will make your idea a reality.

I specialize in web, mobile, and desktop applications, and automated data transformation and conversion. On my Clients page, you can see examples of the type of software I can create for you. I also provide IT Consulting services, such as helping you set up an office network or configuring your servers.

I have many years of experience developing custom software, and I operate my business on the principle that every problem has a proper solution. I value open communication with my clients, and I will work with you to fully understand your needs throughout the development process. [Contact me](http://arsmentis.com/contact) today to discuss your project.
